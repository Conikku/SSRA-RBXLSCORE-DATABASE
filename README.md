this database is for [Super Sonic Robloxia Adventure's](https://www.roblox.com/games/10417853509/Super-Sonic-Robloxia-Adventure) rewrite of rbxlscore, some adjustments were made to scores of some items to be less strict to prevent less false positives

i'd recommend using my fork of rbxlscore that has better scoring logic and cleaner table output to prevent less false positives, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/Conikku/rbxlscore/tree/main)
